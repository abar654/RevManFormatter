      At 3 months, function was 17.96 points with control and 0.09 points better (95% CI 8.36 better to 8.18 worse, 3 studies, 132 participants) with Leucocyte poor.
   treatment success
      THE FOLLOWING OUTCOME IS NOT HANDLED BY SCRIPT FOR THIS COMPARISON, PLEASE IGNORE: treatment success
112 out of 190 (59%) with leucocyte poor PRP at 3 months versus 113 out of 192 (59%) with Subgroup leucocyte rich (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.24, 3 studies).
      29 out of 52 (56%) with leucocyte poor PRP at 3 months versus 23 out of 55 (42%) with Subgroup leucocyte rich (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.06, 2 studies) at Leucocyte poor.

PRP or autologous blood versus steroid injection using MD
   mean pain
      At 3 weeks, mean pain was 3.43 points with steroid injection using MD and 2.06 points worse (95% CI 0.67 worse to 3.45 worse, 5 studies, 280 participants) with PRP or autologous blood.
      At 6 weeks, mean pain was 3.3 points with steroid injection using MD and 0.88 points worse (95% CI 0.06 worse to 1.69 worse, 12 studies, 627 participants) with PRP or autologous blood.
      At 3 months, mean pain was 3.61 points with steroid injection using MD and 1.04 points better (95% CI 1.66 better to 0.42 better, 10 studies, 547 participants) with PRP or autologous blood.
      At 6 months, mean pain was 4.24 points with steroid injection using MD and 1.66 points better (95% CI 2.27 better to 1.06 better, 8 studies, 427 participants) with PRP or autologous blood.
      At 1 year, mean pain was 4.72 points with steroid injection using MD and 1.95 points better (95% CI 2.54 better to 1.35 better, 3 studies, 178 participants) with PRP or autologous blood.
      At >1 year, mean pain was 42.4 points with steroid injection using MD and 21.1 points better (95% CI 31.86 better to 10.34 better, 1 study, 100 participants) with PRP or autologous blood.
