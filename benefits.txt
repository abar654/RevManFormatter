      2 out of 16 (13%) with polidocanol injection versus 3 out of 14 (21%) with Autologous blood (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.83) at 6 weeks. 
      6 out of 16 (38%) with polidocanol injection versus 5 out of 14 (36%) with Autologous blood (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.45) at 3 months. 
      13 out of 16 (81%) with polidocanol injection versus 9 out of 14 (64%) with Autologous blood (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.25) at 6 months.
